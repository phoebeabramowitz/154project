```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
Network retrieved data until the end but sometimes the connection failed, logger has data from when the connection failed but not always until the end
```{r}
#range of epoch, voltage is very inconsistant
#voltage is clearly different scales
range(data_net$voltage)-range(data_log$voltage)
range(data_net$epoch)-range(data_log$epoch)
```
Why does nodeid go so high? 
```{r}
range(data_net$nodeid)-range(data_log$nodeid)

```
