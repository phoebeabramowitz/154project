```{r}
#ASK AROUND on how to read this, igore for now
#datetime <- read.delim("./data/sonoma-dates", header=FALSE)
```

```{r}
#range of epoch, voltage is very inconsistant
#voltage is clearly different scales
range(data_net$voltage)-range(data_log$voltage)
range(data_net$epoch)-range(data_log$epoch)
```
